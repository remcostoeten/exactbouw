## Project goals
don't know yet

## Did
- Scaffold React project with Vite
- Add TailwindCSS  
- Add some basic eslint and prettier config
- Add some basic scripts for cleaning, rebuilding and restarting the project which I always re-use.
- Write readme
- add shadcn for ui components
- redux, redux toolkit, persist, sonner (toast) wouter(router)
- Add items to cart, persist state, remove from cart, allow max qty per item based on stock, mock a checkout view.

## Did not
- tests, no time and little experience so would requrie to much time ti implement. Also love to discuss some test thoughts as it's in my (and alot of others) more often than not a waste of time. *!* very much application dependand *!*)

## Would like to
- add some more tests
- add some more documentation
- feelsl ike a hot mess, would like to refactor, clean up and modularize some things. checkout in a checkout feature for example, but the end results works, and looks decent.

## Experience
I almost exclusvoly develop NextJS exepct for some coorporate SaaS with seperate back-end at my old jobs which weere projects running on 10+ years. State manamgent wise, i've never used Redux, I always opt for Zustand. Regarding testing, little to no experiecne, althrough I know the libraries by name so we'lll see how far I get.
